ASG held our first meeting last night with a great turnout!

We had food and drink provided by our sponsor [Perficient](https://www.perficient.com/), and a short presentation for Cajun Code Fest by Dr. Henry Chu.

From there, we had a presentation on Agile methodologies

and nice discussion on some of the finer points (like what's a point?)

Here are the slides we used for the presentation. Thanks go to Corey and Demain for perparing these.
