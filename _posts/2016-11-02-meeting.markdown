Wednesday November 9th @ 6:30pm we will hold our November Acadiana Software Group meeting! Our community member Raymond will present on using LoopBack framework to build out APIs in the Node.js platform. Join us and watch Raymond show us how pleasant life in the node world can be. The Node.js world continues to gain in popularity among web developers, and will only gain more traction going forward. Come learn how to build REST APIs on Node.js with ease and flexibility.

## Presentation
###Rapid APIs with LoopBack

Raymond will demonstrate the open source LoopBack framework for rapidly building APIs in Node. Loopback is an easy-to-use REST framework built on top of Node.js that simplifies and streamlines the steps to creating a high-performance, scalable REST-api. Node experience isn't required but may give you some context.

## About Acadiana Software Group

The Acadiana Software Group is founded on the premise of providing a Community for the Software minded individuals of the surrounding Acadiana area. Our mission as a group is to facilitate education, knowledge exchange, and community among those who use Software as a profession or hobby. We hope to define this group by the needs of the community and its continual evolution, just as software itself has continued to evolve. We will provide informative presentations, education, and ideas that would enrich and enhance our minds, professions, and hobbies. We intend to bring up important topics and issues that are relative to us as a community. Our end goal is to put you as the center of the group. Ultimately with each person forming the group, we hope to bring a unique culture and a wealth of experience for anyone in the group to utilize.

Thank you for your support and being a part of this community,

ASG Committee
