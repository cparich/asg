We had an excellent presentation by Raymond Camden covering the "Serverless" or "Function As A Service" concept using Apache OpenWhisk.

You can find his slides [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-RNxQ-0YQ48cDJjMnZydEZUQXc)

Thanks for all the support the community has given us throughout our second presentation season! Look forward to our Summer BBQ and the next presentation in September!
