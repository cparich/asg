In March, our beloved [Chris Parich](https://parich.us) made a bit of noise about [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

He also talked up [Bitbucket Pipelines](https://bitbucket.org/product/features/pipelines) and a C++ RESTful engine called [Crow](https://github.com/ipkn/crow).

You can check out his slides [here](https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B-RNxQ-0YQ48X0xjc09TMEdiQkk)
