The September meeting was great.  There were a little over 30 software enthusiasts that showed up.  Alex gave an informative talk on Elixir.

We were at a new location for September.  The Lafayette Science Museum worked out very well.  Thanks again to Paul McCasland who set us up with the space.  I think we'll be back this year.  The best thing about the museum is that it's just a walk across the street to get to Jefferson Street Pub.  We had a big turnout for after-drinks.
