On December 12th @ 6:30pm we will hold our second annual Acadiana Software Group Christmas Social! We plan to celebrate the Christmas season with drinks, food, and socializing with our fellow Software enthusiasts. We would love for you to join us at Agave / Grouse Room on Kaliste Saloom Rd.  If you are interested in RSVP'ing you can respond to this email, however, if you are unsure, feel free to just show up. 

**NOTE:** Don’t forget next month we are doing our Ignite talks to kick off the 2019 year! Please let us in our Slack Channel [#ignite_2019](https://acadianasoftwaregroup.slack.com/messages/C8B5QEDKM/) if you are interested in this brief 5 minute talk. You just need 20 slides and 5 minutes to go over a topic you find interesting. It does not need to be Software focused. It’s a great way to talk about anything interesting and get experience giving presentations! 

## Social

Legends on Johnston Street @ 6:00 pm.
