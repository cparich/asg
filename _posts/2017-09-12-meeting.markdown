## Primary Presentation
 
### Fun with Functions in ES6 and ES7
 
JavaScript has seen a lot of updates with ES6, ES7/ES2015, and ES2016. After a quick highlight reel of some notable ES6 and ES7 features that might've gone unnoticed, Alex will use and explain very basic functional programming techniques to keep your JavaScript understandable and to stop your project from devolving into a giant ball of mud within 2 months.
