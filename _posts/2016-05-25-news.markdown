Although, ASG is going to take a break from talks and presentations during the Summer Time (due to vacations and other reasons), we want to continue our community efforts and the social aspects of your group. This is sure to be an interesting event to come and learn why your chosen IDE, operating system and/or programming language are inadequate in various degrees of uncertainty, confusion, and hilarity.  Please join us for the best part or our monthly user group; the drinks and our charming conversation!

## About Acadiana Software Group

The Acadiana Software Group is founded on the premise of providing a Community for the Software minded individuals of the surrounding Acadiana area. Our mission as a group is to facilitate education, knowledge exchange, and community among those who use Software as a profession or hobby. We hope to define this group by the needs of the community and its continual evolution, just as software itself has continued to evolve. We will provide informative presentations, education, and ideas that would enrich and enhance our minds, professions, and hobbies. We intend to bring up important topics and issues that are relative to us as a community. Our end goal is to put you as the center of the group. Ultimately with each person forming the group, we hope to bring a unique culture and a wealth of experience for anyone in the group to utilize.

Thank you for your support and being a part of this community,

ASG Committee
