[Chris Parich](https://parich.us/) gave ASGs long awaited talk on Modern C++ Fundamentals. He dug deep into some of the new capabilities that the C++ standards committee worked on from 2007 to 2011. It covered topics of interest for people ranging from practicing C++ enthusiast to people knocking the dust off of the part of their brain that last dealt with C++ in school.

About a dozen of us went to Grub Burger for eats and drinks afterwards.
