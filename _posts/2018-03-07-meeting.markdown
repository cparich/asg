### Hello Wearable World! Design and Development of Applications for Wearable Tech

This talk is about developing apps for wearable devices. I plan to give a brief overview of the technologies used and show how tech-minded people with programming experience as well as creative people who have interesting ideas for this platform can get involved.

### Presenter

Dr. Charles Cavanaugh holds a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Texas at Arlington, studying real-time distributed computer systems.
